Fantasy Cricket Game is a game where we can create a virtual cricket team of real cricket players. Each player has their own Points. There will be a limited no. of points to select 11 players, if we don’t have enough points we can’t select a player if his points are more and the team is evaluated using points of each player based on their performance internally. To win a tournament, we must try and get the maximum points and the №1 rank amongst other participants.
